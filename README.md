<h1>Blazon Language Render Tool</h1>
<h6>9/3/2024, 10:50 PM ~ Complete Rendering Demo</h6>
This is a tentatively complete version of the rendering code.
<h6>Dependencies</h6>
I installed pretty much whatever packages random people on stack 
overflow/linux forums/reddit told others to install, resulting in
the installation of a lot of unhelpful stuff. I think the packages
that are actually needed are:
<ul>
<li>pycairo</li>
<li>PIL (pillow)</li>
</ul>
I'm also in Python 3.12. I started out in a lower version but 
something broke so keep that in mind if you try to set it up for 
yourself.
<h6>To Run</h6>
Run main.py. Output will appear in the <i>rendering/img</i> 
directory unless specified otherwise. 
I also left extensive comments in main.py that should explain the
format of the program as well as some preliminary instructions on
how to render some basic images on your own, if you are so inclined.
